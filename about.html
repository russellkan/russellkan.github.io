                    Hi! I'm a 5th year Biomedical Engineering student currently attending the University of Texas at Austin. I enjoy logic puzzles, bad puns, and taking showers. When I'm not drowning in schoolwork, you can catch me awake at all hours of the night being eternally unproductive. If you're in the area, hit me up for a meal even if it's 4 AM!
